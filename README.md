Hello Everyone,
This is my first time building this type of app so if you have any suggestion you can send your suggestion to the email-id that is  provided in the website.
Instruction:
It is quite easy to use this just like any other weather app.
1. You can choose current location for checking weather for your city.
2. If it shows any error you can check your weather by searching location like this (Texas, US).
3. There are not much features in it but I will try to add more in the future.
4. Last just have fun using our app and don't forget if you have any queries and suggestion you can send it directly to me.
   Thanks.
